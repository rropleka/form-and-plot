The objective is to provide quick visual feedback  on how user selections affect the business outcome (e.g.  option selection to recommended).  
Technically, user selections in a HTML form are sent to an API server as json and the output from the API server is plotted

The mock up API server is implemented using Flask and allows CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) Headers
